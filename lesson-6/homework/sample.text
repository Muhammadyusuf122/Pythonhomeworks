Powerful and fast-flying, the Peregrine Falcon hunts medium-sized birds, dropping down on them from high above 
in a spectacular stoop.They were virtually eradicated from eastern North America by pesticide poisoning 
in the middle 20th century.After significant recovery efforts, Peregrine Falcons have made an incredible rebound 
and are now regularly seen in many large cities and coastal areas.
